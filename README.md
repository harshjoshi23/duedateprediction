# duedateprediction

The objective of the first half of the winter internship project is:
  ● To build a Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it
  gets created in the system.
  ● Categorize the invoice into different buckets based on predicted payment date.
  
  For example:
  Let’s suppose Walmart wishes to add 20,000 Nike shoes to its sports department.
  Now, Walmart becomes the buyer business whereas Nike is the seller business. Since
  this is B2B, the business is done on credit.
  After successful delivery of the shoes, Nike establishes a Payment term within which
  Walmart must pay it’s total open amount, let’s suppose $1.2M.
  If Walmart is unable to pay within the decided payment term, it becomes the duty of
  the Account receivables department of Nike to follow up and get Walmart to pay the
  outstanding amount.
  You will be receiving an invoices dataset that contains the past payment information and
  behaviour of various buyers. Based on the previous payment patterns, the ML model needs to
  predict what will be the date a payment is made by the customer for an invoice.
  The model also needs to predict which aging bucket the invoice falls into based on the
  predicted payment date.
